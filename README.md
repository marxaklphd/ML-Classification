# ML-Classification
Here I show and illustrate the use of many ML classifiers used on a random data set, plotting their results, comparing in some cases and drawing some conclusions
For example in one file : I use the MNIST data set with the k-nearest neighbor classifier, and I improve the accuracy of the classifier to over 97% using a grid 
search CV over the number of neighbors as first perimeter and and the weights method as second perimeter with 5 total crossfolds.
